= Facebook images not always showing up. What should I do? =

You've probably switched the “Dynamic Grid” option to “On”. The dynamic grid works as follows: 
1st and 2nd post appear with image. 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th post appear without the image. 7th and 8th post appear with image. And so on.

If you want all your posts to have images, please switch dynamic grid to “Off”.
